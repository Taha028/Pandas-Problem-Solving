# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
df=pd.merge(db_employee,db_dept,how='left',left_on=['department_id'],right_on=['id'])
marketing_max_salary = df.loc[df['department'] == 'marketing', 'salary'].max()
engineering_max_salary=df.loc[df['department']=='engineering','salary'].max()
salary_diff=abs(marketing_max_salary-engineering_max_salary)
